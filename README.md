# mongoose-control

Migration and seed/fixtures framework for node (v16+) and mongoose (v7+).

This project is based in: 

- [`node-mongoose-fixtures`](https://github.com/kennethklee/node-mongoose-fixtures), by [Kenneth Lee](https://github.com/kennethklee).
- [`node-mongodb-migrations`](https://github.com/neverbot/node-mongodb-migrations), by [Ivan Alonso (neverbot)](https://github.com/neverbot) forked from [`ikatun/node-migrate`](https://github.com/ikatun/node-migrate), in turn forked from [`tj/node-migrate`](https://github.com/tj/node-migrate) by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj).

Both projects use the MIT license. Please check its authors files for more information.
Both projects seem to be discontinued, so I decided to merge some of their features and create this new project.
